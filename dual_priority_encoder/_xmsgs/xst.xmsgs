<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="old" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">4</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">out</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="646" delta="old" >Signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">first_decode&lt;15:12&gt;</arg>&gt; is assigned but never used. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.
</msg>

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="1290" delta="old" >Hierarchical block &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">d4</arg>&gt; is unconnected in block &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">ins_decoder</arg>&gt;.
It will be removed from the design.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
